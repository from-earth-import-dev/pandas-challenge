    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is clear from the analysis that Charter schools outperform district schools. While the Charter schools do tend to be smaller in size (average size for Charter is 1717, versus 4063 for District), the Charter schools do have, on average, nearly 45 dollars less budget per student than the district schools. \n",
    "\n",
    "* All together, the district is seeing better scores in reading than in math. This is true both from the aggregate, average score of reading versus math grades (81.8 compared to 78.9, respectively) but is even more evident when reviewing the percentage of students that passed reading as compared to math (85.8 compared to 74.9, respectively). Given that the median for reading scores is 3 points higher than math scores (82 compared to 79, respectively), it can also be said that more students generally score higher grades in reading than math, as opposed to more students simply passing with low grades. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Lastly, the goal of any school district is to provide a suitable education so that all students are able to progress adequately with each year of school, and ideally, improve their grades with ample teaching, practice, focus. Based on data of average math scores collected from each grade of each school in the district, it's noted that for math, students improve by two tenths of a point their junior year (80.57) as compared to students' freshman and sophomore years (80.35 and 80.37, respectively). That number drops off during the students senior year (senioritis?) back down to 80.42, but an improvement nonetheless. The same improvement from freshman/sophomore years to junior/senior years is not seen in reading scores, where district-wide, across all four grades, the range stays within 0.05 points. This could indicate that students enter high school with high reading proficiency, and maintain that proficiency through all four years. Alternatively, the leap in math may indicate that students have more room to improve, and through adequate teaching, that improvement is realized across the district during the students four years. More data and analysis would be required to better draw these conclusions.\n",
